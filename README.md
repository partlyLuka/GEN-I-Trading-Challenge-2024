# GEN-I Trading Challenge

This repository holds my code which I used when competing in the GEN-I trading challenge. 

The challenge consisted of forecasting various time series and then deriving useful information from analytic findings. 

# Task 1
It consisted of forecasting energy consumption one day in advanced in Slovenia based on historical data and other various data which one could gather. 

# Task 2
Consisted of predicting Intra-Day auction prices for electricity one day in advance. It utilised several datasets such as weather data, scheduled commercial exchange data, scheduled generation and load of electricity data, historic stock data and others datasets.

# Task 3
In task 3, I used the predictions of electricity prices one day in advance to utilise battery optimistion. I achieved this via Linear Programming.
